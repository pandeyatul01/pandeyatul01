I am a highly motivated Data Analyst with a strong background in data analysis, visualization, and reporting. I have hands-on experience in using tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Metabase to create interactive dashboards and reports. My expertise lies in extracting, transforming, and analyzing data from various sources to provide actionable insights for business decisions. I have worked on projects ranging from university admissions data analysis, where I helped improve admission processes, to building machine learning models for insurance fraud detection. Proficient in SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), and Excel (VBA & Macros), I am skilled in data preprocessing, data modeling, and developing insightful visualizations. With a proven ability to work in cross-functional teams and deliver results within tight deadlines, I thrive on solving complex problems and driving data-driven strategies. I am eager to apply my skills in dynamic, data-centric environments and organization.
